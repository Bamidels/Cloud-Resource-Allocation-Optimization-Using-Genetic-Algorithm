# Cloud-Resource-Allocation-Optimization-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
Cloud computing environments often face challenges in efficiently allocating resources to meet varying demands from users and applications. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a genetic algorithm (GA) solution to optimize resource allocation in a cloud environment.
# Cloud Resource Allocation Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction
In this project, we address the challenge of cloud resource allocation by implementing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that dynamically allocates Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical servers. Our objective is to maximize resource utilization and minimize energy consumption, which are critical concerns in cloud computing environments.

## Project Results
After running our GA, we observed continuous improvement in the fitness score over 100 generations, indicating an effective optimization process. The final best fitness score achieved was 0.970703125, suggesting an efficient allocation of VMs to servers. 

### Fitness Score Progression
- Generation 0: 0.904296875
- Generation 10: 0.932421875
- Generation 20: 0.951953125
- Generation 30: 0.959375
- ... (truncated for brevity)
- Generation 90: 0.970703125

The best allocation was achieved with the following distribution of VMs across servers:
`[1, 1, 9, 7, ...]`

## Key Components
- **Genetic Algorithm**: A robust GA that evolves solutions to optimize VM allocations.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Simulated monitoring of resource usage to inform the GA's decision-making.
- **Fitness Function**: A comprehensive function that evaluates allocation based on server utilization, response time, and energy efficiency.
- **Simulation Environment**: A testbed that generates synthetic workloads to evaluate the GA's allocation decisions.
- **Visualization and Analysis**: Tools to analyze and visualize the GA's performance across generations, providing insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

## Visualization
We have included a graph that demonstrates the evolution of the best fitness score over generations, showing the GA's capability in refining the allocation strategy.
